[explanation]
text = """
Early-evening plaza strolling implies low desired pace and gentle interactions. We reduce direct goal drive (goal_attractive_force=0.85, desired_force.factor=0.9) and cap speeds (max_speed_multiplier=1.1) with slower adaptations (tau=0.7, relaxation_time=0.7) to reflect meandering and photo stops (larger goal_threshold=0.5 so agents settle without oscillation).

Families move in groups, so we enhance cohesion and mutual orientation (group_coherence_force=4.5, group_gaze_force=5.0) while allowing closer within-group spacing (group_repulsive_force.factor=0.8, threshold=0.5).

The open plaza has few tight constraints, so we soften space/obstacle effects (space_repulsive_force.factor=0.8; obstacle_force.factor=6.0, sigma=0.25, threshold=2.5). Pedestrian avoidance is smoother and anticipatory rather than abrupt (ped_repulsive_force.factor=1.2, v0=1.8, sigma=0.35). A modestly wide FOV (110°) with low out-of-view reaction (0.3) matches casual attention where people are less responsive to rear approaches.

Resolution = 1 follows the 1 m per unit scale. Along-wall tendency is mild (along_wall_force.factor=0.3) to reflect window-shopping near edges without strong channeling.
