[explanation]
text = """
Late-morning visitors amble, so desired speeds and accelerations are modest: increased relaxation_time (0.7), lower max_speed_multiplier (1.15), and slightly reduced goal attraction (0.9).
Families and friends tend to keep together while strolling between kiosks and viewpoints: higher group coherence and gaze forces (3.5) with moderate intra-group repulsion (0.9).
Promenade walking involves awareness mainly ahead and to the sides while sightseeing; we widen FOV a bit (110°) but decrease out-of-view influence (0.45).
The triangular construction zone to the northwest and the closed block to the east require early, strong avoidance: higher obstacle force factor (12.0) with a larger anticipation threshold (5 m) and slightly broader decay (sigma 0.25).
Crowd density is moderate; pedestrian repulsion is set to 1.3 to avoid bunching while maintaining a relaxed flow; agent radius is slightly larger (0.38 m) to reflect bags and casual spacing.
Resolution is 1 m per unit to match the scene scale, and wall-following is enabled to help agents align with the promenade edges.
