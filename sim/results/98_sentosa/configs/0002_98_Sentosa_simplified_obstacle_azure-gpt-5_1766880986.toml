[explanation]
# Chosen for mixed-speed cross-traffic between the northern boardwalk and southern seating terraces. Joggers require quick adaptation and higher top speeds, so step_width is reduced (0.3 s), relaxation_time is short (0.4 s), and max_speed_multiplier is raised (1.5). Cross-traffic with intersecting headings needs broader anticipation, so pedestrian FOV is widened to 120° and ped_repulsive_force is strengthened (factor 2.0, v0 2.5, sigma 0.35) to resolve frequent conflicts without oscillations. Agent radius 0.34 m reflects light-clothing adults in a plaza. Moderate group forces (coherence 1.5, gaze 2.5) allow small staff pairs to stay together while joggers remain mostly independent; group_repulsive threshold 0.6 prevents groups from clogging crossings. Obstacle force is elevated (9.0) with 3 m threshold to keep flows off planter/terrace edges while the open plaza remains attractive. Social force anisotropy (lambda 2.2, gamma 0.36) supports lane formation and smoother head-on avoidance. Resolution is set to 1 unit per meter to match scene scale, and along_wall influence is disabled for open-plaza cutting across paths.
