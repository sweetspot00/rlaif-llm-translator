[explanation]
# These parameters model a controlled mobility clinic in an open plaza with cones/markers. Agents move cautiously with assistance, so desired movement is gentle (goal_attractive_force 0.9, desired_force factor 0.9) and acceleration/response is slower (scene.tau and desired_force.relaxation_time at 0.8). To reflect mobility devices and safety buffers, agent_radius is increased to 0.4 m, and person-person avoidance is strengthened and longer-ranged (ped_repulsive_force factor 2.2, v0 3.0, sigma 0.45) with wider awareness (fov_phi 140°, fov_factor 0.6). Group dynamics are important for patient–assistant pairs: strong cohesion (group_coherence_force 5.0) and coordination (group_gaze_force 3.0), while allowing close proximity within the pair (group_repulsive_force 0.6, threshold 0.7). Cones and markers act as numerous small obstacles shaping lanes, so obstacle avoidance is emphasized (obstacle_force factor 12.0, sigma 0.25, threshold 2.5) and space repulsion discourages squeezing through tight gaps (space_repulsive_force factor 1.2, u0 12, r 0.25). Maximum speed is capped conservatively (max_speed_multiplier 1.1) and step width 0.4 s provides stable updates for slow, deliberate rolling.
