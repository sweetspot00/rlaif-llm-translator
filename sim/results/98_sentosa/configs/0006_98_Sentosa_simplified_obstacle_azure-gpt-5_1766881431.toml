[explanation]
# A school group moving together from the north entrance to a southwest photo spot benefits from strong intra-group cohesion and gaze alignment, so group_coherence_force and group_gaze_force are set high, while group_repulsive_force is reduced with a lower threshold to allow close walking and clustering at the goal. A slightly stronger goal attraction and a small goal_threshold help the group converge tightly at the photo location. Moderate ped_repulsive settings with a 120° field of view and reduced out-of-view influence capture forward-focused navigation typical of following a leader. Obstacle forces are elevated to ensure benches/walls around the southwest seating area are strongly avoided. Pace and responsiveness (step_width, tau, relaxation_time, max_speed_multiplier) are tuned for a steady, cohesive group walk rather than fast individual motion. Resolution is set to 1 to match 1 meter per unit, and the agent radius of 0.3 m supports close but comfortable group spacing.
