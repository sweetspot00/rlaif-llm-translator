[explanation]
# The tour is slow-moving and cohesive, with wheelchairs and escorts traveling together from north to south. A larger agent_radius (0.45 m) approximates wheelchair footprint and side-by-side pacing. Reduced max_speed_multiplier (1.1), a slightly longer scene tau (0.6), and desired_force relaxation_time (0.7) temper accelerations to reflect guided, steady motion. Strong group_coherence (4.0) and moderate group_gaze (3.5) keep escorts close to wheelchairs and maintain formation, while a reduced group_repulsive factor (0.6) and smaller intra-group threshold (0.45) allow closer spacing within the tour. Pedestrian repulsion is strengthened (factor 1.9, v0 2.2) with a wider FOV (120°) to ensure comfortable interpersonal distances around wheelchairs. Obstacle avoidance is increased (factor 12.0, threshold 4.0) so the group anticipates curbs/edges and navigates safely toward the southern terrace. Resolution set to 1 m/unit matches the scene scale; goal and desired force factors are slightly reduced to encourage smooth, unhurried progress.
