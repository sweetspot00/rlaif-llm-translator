eth, A cold winter daytime scene on an ETH campus walkway: snow blankets the lawns while pedestrians funnel through a cleared central path. People mostly move straight through between building entrances and the upper concourse, creating a steady bidirectional ambulatory flow with frequent small detours and courteous avoidance.
hotel, A daytime street-level scene beside a hotel and sidewalk corridor, where pedestrians pass through a slightly constrained path bordered by building edges and street furniture. The flow is moderate and continuous—people walk alone or in pairs, occasionally slowing, yielding, or adjusting trajectories near narrow sections and corners.
zara01, A daytime pedestrian shopping-area/courtyard scene near a Zara, with flows splitting and merging around open-space geometry and storefront entrances. The crowd exhibits frequent turning, short stops, and group coordination (pairs/triples), creating dynamic local density patches and continuous low-speed avoidance.
gcs, Daytime inside New York’s Grand Central Terminal, commuters and visitors walk between platforms, exits, and meeting points, occasionally stopping to check directions or wait for companions while weaving past others in close proximity.
